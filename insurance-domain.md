# Insurance Domain Knowledge and Basics

The purpose of insurance is to provide protection against the risk of any financial loss. Insurance is a contract between the insurer and the insured person or a group. The insured person is the individual covered by the insurance policy, and the insurer is the insurance company that sells the policies. Insurance is a form of risk management where the insurer agrees to take on the risk of the insured entity against future events, uncertain loss, etc. In return, the insured person pays a monetary compensation to the insurance company, termed as a "premium".

Individuals, businesses, or other entities can use insurance policies to protect against significant losses and financial suffering, with the premium amount increasing as the risk increases.

## Importance of Insurance

Nowadays, insurance is an important part of life. Most people have some type of insurance policy, though not everyone understands its importance. Insurance provides financial protection against uncertain loss. For instance, if a breadwinner passes away, insurance ensures that their business or family members receive benefits agreed upon in the policy. This financial security helps maintain the family's standard of living even in the insured person's absence.

## How Does Insurance Work?

Insurance cannot prevent unfortunate events but prepares individuals and businesses for the worst by protecting them and their assets from financial risk or loss. The insurance business includes various operations to generate sufficient income to pay claims and generate profit to remain competitive.

Here’s how insurance works:

- **Risk Management Cost**: Insurance companies bear the risk of the insured person, and managing this risk incurs costs.
- **Risk Sharing**: The cost of risk is spread across a large group of people sharing similar risks.
- **Premium Payment**: When you buy an insurance policy, you transfer your risk to the insurance company in exchange for a premium.
- **Funding Pool**: Premiums from various policyholders create a large pool of funds used to cover claims in case of unexpected events.
- **Claim Settlement**: After claim acceptance, the insurer settles the claim following verification.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If there is a dispute regarding a claim, you can contact the insurer or the Financial Ombudsman for an independent and free service.

## Types of Insurance

There are several types of insurance available in the market, each serving different needs:

1. **Life Insurance**: A contract between a policyholder and an insurance company where the company agrees to pay benefits upon the insured person's death or policy maturity.
2. **Property Insurance**: Protects property against fire, weather damage, or theft. Covers buildings, flats, or personal property like office equipment.
